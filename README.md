Here’s a clean and simple **README file** for the topic **Flask** that you can use for a project.

---

# Flask Web Application

## 📌 Overview

This project is a web application built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework. Flask is designed to make web development simple and flexible.

Flask is maintained by **Armin Ronacher** and is part of the **Pallets Projects**.

---

## 🚀 What is Flask?

**Flask** is a micro web framework written in **Python**.
It is called a *micro* framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It is lightweight and easy to extend.

---

## ✨ Features

* Lightweight and simple
* Built-in development server
* RESTful request handling
* Jinja2 templating engine
* Easy routing system
* Highly flexible and modular

---

## 🛠 Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. Then install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```

## ▶️ Basic Example

Create a file named `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🌍 How Routing Works

In Flask, routes are defined using decorators:

```python
@app.route("/about")
def about():
    return "This is the About page"
```
